\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:concl}

In this paper, we propose the FPGA-based implementation of BLAST algorithm called HBlast. The proposed architecture utilizes the parallel search processing, the efficiency of which is determined in the analysis part. 


Indeed, this project aims to be one of the several FPGA-based implementations of search algorithms. For the time being, the proposed architecture is available as open source and can be accessed by following source \cite{HBlast2019}. The larger project will constitute a library of hardware accelerators targeting cloud-based FPGA instances. The accessibility of the accelerators in the public domain will enable interested organizations to achieve hardware acceleration through cloud-based infrastructures such as Amazon AWS FPGA instances. In fact, this will be effective and suitable for research centres with limited computing facilities. Moreover, by having a communication infrastructure for interfacing the accelerators with standard PCIe and DRAM interfaces, accelerators, such as the proposed one in this paper, could be also used in personal FPGAs.

BLAST algorithm is used to search for similar parts of biological sequences in a database and a query~\cite{Stephen1990}. 
Both the database and the query sequences are represented using strings of English alphabet with each letter representing a nucleobase such as Adenine or Thymine.
There are multiple implementations of BLAST based on the type of data they process. 
DNA sequence search uses nucleotides with 4-letter  representation and protein search uses amino-acids with 20-letter representation. 
The inputs to BLAST are two sequences; a database, which consists of a large amount of classified data such as known viral DNAs, and a query, such as a piece of unknown DNA, which has to be compared with the database and find the similar parts. 
The outputs from the algorithm are the degree~(score) of similarity of the aligned parts and their corresponding location in the sequences. 
Each matched pair between the database and the query is called a High Score Pair~(HSP) and is of extreme importance for further biological computations. 
BLAST algorithm consists of 3 primary steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textit{Pre-processing the query sequence}. The query is divided into several small portions/words.} 
\item{\textit{Searching for hit}. Obtained small words of query are compared to the data in database to determine the exact match.}
\item{\textit{Expansion of comparison around hits}. Locations where the sequences coincide, the comparison is continued to both sides and HSP is calculated.}
\end{itemize}
Details of each step is discussed in detail below.

\subsubsection{\bf Pre-processing}
In this step, a query is divided into a list of substrings, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:step12}~(a). 
These substrings are called W-mers of length W~\cite{sotiriades2007design}. 
Let us assume we have a query DNA sequence ACGTAAARGCAG of length 12 and W-mers of length 3 \cite{sotiriades2007design}. 
Since the W-mers are contiguous substrings, there are in total 10 W-mers. 
The total number of W-mers in a querry can be calculated as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
No.of \ Wmers = Query \ Length - Wmer \ Length + 1 
\end{equation}
The substring ACG will be the first W-mer, CGT the second and so on. 



\subsubsection{\bf Searching for hits}
After the query is divided and the list of W-mers is generated, the search for exact match between W-mers and database is conducted.
W-mers are chosen and randomly compared with the portions of the database. 
Every exact match found is recorded as a ``hit" and saved to process further in step 3 as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:step12}~(b). 


\subsubsection{\bf Expansion}
After sufficient number of hits are found, each W-mer with exact match is expanded locally to both directions (left and right) by single letter per direction at a time as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:step3}. 
The expansion continues until the scoring no longer gets improved.

The scoring technique of the algorithm is based on the Point Accepted Mutations~(PAM) matrices, that are used to examine which amino-acid substitutions are biologically accepted~\cite{sotiriades2007design}. 
However, due to the complexity of this technique, a simpler and biologically acceptable scoring method is generally used. 
In the expansion stage, each new match will results in addition of 5 points to the score and any mismatch will lead to reduction of 4 from the score as depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:step3}.
The expansion ceases when the score calculated after an expansion becomes less than the score before expansion.
The sub-strings with maximum scores are selected and are called HSPs.
The HSPs and the corresponding score are reported as the final output of the algorithm.
